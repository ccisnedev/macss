> A **requisition** is a formal request that a change be made — the business need that originates the work. (Spanish: *solicitud*.)

> **All fields are mandatory.**
> Structure based on *Gap Analysis* — BABOK® v3 (IIBA), ch. 8.
> Domain terminology aligned with *Ubiquitous Language* — Domain-Driven Design (Eric Evans, 2003).

## 1. Current State (AS-IS)

<!-- BABOK® — Current State Description -->

Describe how the thing you want to change is done **today**. If it is something new that does not exist, write: *"Does not currently exist"*.

> **Example:** *"Invoice registration is currently done in a shared Excel sheet. Each analyst opens the file, finds the last row, and enters the data manually. Sometimes two people edit at once and records are lost."*

<!-- Use the domain's ubiquitous language (Ubiquitous Language — DDD). -->

## 2. Desired State (TO-BE)

<!-- BABOK® — Future State Description -->

Describe how you **want it to work** in the future. You do not need to give the technical solution, only the expected result.

> **Example:** *"The system must have an invoice registration form with fields: number, amount, supplier, and date. It must not allow duplicate records. On save, the information must be available to all users without risk of loss."*
